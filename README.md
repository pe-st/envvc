# envvc

`envvc.exe` sets the environment on the command line for a given version of Microsoft Visual C++.

Originally it was written in 2005 and updated in [2007][blog] and 2010 to help using Visual C++ compilers and tools from the command line.

[Currently (2017)][update-2017-01] it is still in occasional use, but the latest supported version of Visual Studio is 2010 SP1,
because that's the one I still work with...
